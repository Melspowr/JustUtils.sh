This is an script of an idea I had to compress files with 7z and convert them with ffmpeg. As I said this may be work in progress and it will be slowly thanks that I'm busy with studing this year.

I plan to launch it for UNIX based platforms, if eventually is useful and interest is done for windows I might consider it. 

Honestly, I plan to open a donation panel somewhere because I want to earn the sufficient money to buy a Librem5.
