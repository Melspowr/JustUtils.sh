This will be an script of an idea I had, to compress files with 7z and convert them with ffmpeg. As I said this may be work in progress and it will be slowly thanks that I'm busy with studing this year.

I plan to launch it for UNIX based platforms, if eventually is useful and interest is done for windows I might consider it. 

__I don't think I'm going to start it early__. ;-;
