This is an script of an idea I had to compress files with 7z and convert them with ffmpeg. As I said this may be work in prorgess and it will be slowly thanks that I'm busy with studing this year.

Honestly, I plan to open a donation panel somewhere because I want to earn the sufficient money to buy a Librem5.
